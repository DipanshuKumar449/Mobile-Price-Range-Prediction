# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
Using ML Algorithms, Predicting the Mobile Price Ranges.

Mobile now a days is one of the most selling and purchasing device. Every day new mobiles with new version and more features are launched. Hundreds and thousands of mobiles are sold and purchased on daily basis.

Therefore, Price estimation and prediction is an important part of consumer strategy as a new product that has to be launched, must have the correct price so that the consumers find it appropriate to buy the product. During the purchase of mobile phones, people fail to make correct decisions due to the non-availability of necessary resources to cross validate the price. To address this issue, we developed different classification models using the data related to different features of a mobile phone. The developed model is then used to predict the price range of the new mobile phones.

The main objective of this work is to find out the relationship between features of a mobile phone and its price range which indicates whether the mobile would be cheap(0), mid-range(1), expensive(2) or very expensive(3). We will be using different classification models to accurately classify the data in correct price ranges
